Peel Utility Library Version 1.0.0

(c) Alastair Macleod Productions Inc 2009

Release under LGPL License 2010

The purpose of this library is to provide wrapper classes for commonly used functions
to make code more readable and provide platform abstraction.

Rather than putting a bunch of #ifdef _WIN32 in the code, the platform specific
functionality should be put here as a factory/concrete classes which can be used
on any platform.

The goal of this library is to be a lightweight alternative for libraries such as
boost or qt, which are awesome, but very large.
